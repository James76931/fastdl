# README
# This script is intended to work only for Valve SRCDS (Source) servers using Daniel Gibbs Linux Game Servers Management script
# It's been tested for Debian 8 but other debian and distros should also work
# After running this, you have to setup an HTTP server pointing to the fastdl folder that will be created
# Of course, you will also have to change your server configuration's sv_downloadurl
# If my work helped you, please consider making a donation on www.mesnie.org
