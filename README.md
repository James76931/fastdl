# fastdl
# A FastDL script, initially made for Gmod and Daniel Gibbs Linux Game Server Manager.
# README
# This script is intended to work only for Valve SRCDS (Source) servers using Daniel Gibbs Linux Game Servers Management script
# It's been tested for Debian 8 but other debian and distros should also work
# After running this, you have to setup an HTTP server pointing to the fastdl folder that will be created
# Of course, you will also have to change your server configuration
# If my work helped you, please consider making a donation on www.mesnie.org
