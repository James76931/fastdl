# fastdl
A FastDL script, initially made for Gmod and Daniel Gibbs Linux Game Server Manager.
# Instructions 
- Copy autofastdl to your server root (next to serverfiles folder)
- Do chmod +x autofastdl
- Run the script : ./autofastdl
- Follow instructions

# README
This script is intended to work only for Valve SRCDS (Source) servers using Daniel Gibbs Linux Game Servers Management script
It's been tested for Debian 8 but other debian and distros should also work
After running this, you have to setup an HTTP server pointing to the fastdl folder that will be created
Of course, you will also have to change your server configuration
